## **Agenda** {.test}

::: incremental
-   Introduction to PCA; Cluster analysis and Report writing in R

-   **My goal is to make you excited about how to perform this analysis in R!**

-   I will entertain **questions** at the end
:::

## Packages Used Today {.test}

::: incremental
-   Here we are going to focuses on PCA [`factoextra`](https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/factoextra/index.html).

- `PCA` is used to summarize the information contained in a continuous (i.e, quantitative) multivariate data by reducing the dimensionality of the data without loosing important information.
:::

```{r load}
#| echo: true
#| include: true

library(factoextra) 
```

## Principal Component Analysis {.test}

::: {.incremental}

- Principal component analysis (PCA) allows us to summarize and visualize the information in a data set containing individuals/observations described by multiple inter-correlated quantitative variables.

- Each variable could be considered as a different dimension. 

- If you have more than 3 variables in your data sets, it could be very difficult to visualize a multi-dimensional hyperspace.

- The goal of PCA is to identify directions (or Principal Components) along which the direction in the data is maximal.
:::

## PCA Continuation {.test}

:::{.incremental}

- Principal component analysis is used to extract the important information from a multivariate data table and to express this information as a set of few new variables called principal components. 

- These new variables correspond to a linear combination of the originals. 

- The number of principal components is less than or equal to the number of original variables.

- The information in a given data set corresponds to the total variation it contains. The goal of PCA is to identify directions (or principal components) along which the variation in the data is maximal.

- PCA is very useful when variable within the dataset are highly correlated.
:::

## R packages {.test}

::: {.incremental}

Several functions from different packages are available in the R software for computing PCA:

- prcomp() and princomp() [built-in R stats package]

- **PCA() [FactoMineR package]**

- **dudi.pca() [ade4 package]**

- **epPCA() [ExPosition package]**

- No matter what function you decide to use, you can easily extract and visualize the results of PCA using R functions provided in the factoextra R package.

:::

## Install the package as follow: {.test}

::: {.incremental}

- install.packages("factoextra")

- Load them in R, by typing this:

- library("factoextra")

:::

## Visualization and Interpretation of PCA Results with factoextra R Package

::: {.incremental}

- **get_eigenvalue** (res.pca): Extract the eigenvalues/variances of principal components.

- **fviz_eig** (res.pca): Visualize the eigenvalues

- **get_pca_ind** (res.pca), **get_pca_var** : Extract the results for individual and variable respectively.

- **fviz_pca_ind**, **fviz_pca_var** (res.pca): Visualize the results of individual and variables, respectively.

- **fviz_pca_biplot** (res.pca): Make a biplot of individuals and variables.
:::

## Eigenvalues or Variances {.test}

::: {.incremental}

- The eigenvalues measure the amount of variation retained by each principal component.

- The eigenvalues are larger for the first PCs and small for the subsequent PCs.

- The first PCs corresponds to the directions with the maximum amount of variation in the data set.

- Eigenvalues can be used to determine the number of principal components to retain after PCA (Kaiser, 1961).

- An eigenvalue > 1 indicates that PCs account for more variance than accounted by one of the original variables in standardized data. This is commonly used as cutoff point for which PCs are retained. 

- The above point holds true only when the data are standardized.
