## Data Wrangling: Practical

# Import `sorghum.xlsx` to R and
# save to an object named example03



# How many observations do we have per environment?



# How many `environment?`
#`genotypes?` Display the list of
#locations and the list of `genotypes respectively?`


# Display the data where
#the `yield was less than 150?`



# Select `env`, `gen`, `yield`, to be saved in a
#new object `example03.short` and
#create a new variable `mean_yield`
#by by computing the mean of the `yield.`
