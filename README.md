# Training on Statistics and Data Analysis using R

This repository contains the documentation, exercises and datasets of a three day workshop ['Training on Statistics and Data Analysis using R'](https://bb1464.github.io/workshop-introduction-to-R/) at CPEB Club, University of Ibadan, 2023

## Workshop description

R is a powerful programming language for data handling, data visualization, and statistics. In this workshop, we aim to give you the tools to start exploring R and all it has to offer by yourself.

The course will take you from the very basics in R syntax, to data handling and visualization using a set of packages designed for data science, known as the 'tidyverse'. We will also take some time to understand datasets and their architecture, preparing you to handle your own data in a clean, robust, and reproducible manner. We will work in RStudio and introduce R scripts as well as the R Markdown format along side with quarto: the latter is a great way to combine code and its output with text, allowing you to code in a narrative and intuitive way. Moreover, this way you produce a human-readable document with which you can easily share and showcase your work.
